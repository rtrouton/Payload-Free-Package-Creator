5. Once you've entered a name for the installer package, you'll be prompted for a package identifier. By default, the name filled in will be **com.github.payload_free**, but this name should be changed to be something unique.

***How Payload-Free Package Creator.app works***


**Payload-Free Package Creator.app** is an Automator application that uses AppleScript, shell scripting and pkgbuild behind the scenes to create payload-free packages. When a script is selected, the following process takes place:

1. The script is copied to **/tmp** and renamed to **postinstall**, to match the name that pkgbuild is expecting for a post-installation script.

2. After the package name and package identifier are chosen, **/tmp** is checked to make sure that there is not an existing directory that is named the same as the chosen name. If a matching directory is found, it is removed.

3. A new directory is created in **/tmp** that matches the chosen name of the package.

4. Next, a **scripts** directory and an empty directory named **nopayload** are created inside of **/tmp/package_name_here**. The **nopayload** directory provides the empty directory for **pkgbuild**'s **--root** option

5. The **postinstall** script is moved to **/tmp/package_name_here/scripts**

6. The payload-free package is built by pkgbuild using the postinstall script stored in **/tmp/package_name_here/scripts**

7. The payload-free package is then converted to a distribution package using productbuild.

8. The finished payload-free package is stored in **/tmp/package_name_here** and the user is prompted that the process is finished.

9. Once the user is notified and clicks OK, a new Finder window opens for **/tmp/package_name_here**
